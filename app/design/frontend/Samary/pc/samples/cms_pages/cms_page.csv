<dl class=""custom-page privacy-policy-page"">
    <dt class=""heading-5"">General information</dt>
    <dd>Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! When you use our store services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. When you share information with us, we can make our services even better for you. For instance, we can show you more relevant search results and ads, help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully. Remember, you can find controls to manage your information and protect your privacy and security. We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible.</dd>
    <dt class=""heading-5"">Right to access, correct and delete data and to object to data processing</dt>
    <dd>Our customers have the right to access, correct and delete personal data relating to them, and to object to the processing of such data, by addressing a written request, at any time. The Company makes every effort to put in place suitable precautions to safeguard the security and privacy of personal data, and to prevent it from being altered, corrupted, destroyed or accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, the Company does not control each and every risk related to the use of the Internet, and therefore warns the Site users of the potential risks involved in the functioning and use of the Internet. The Site may include links to other web sites or other internet sources. As the Company cannot control these web sites and external sources, the Company cannot be held responsible for the provision or display of these web sites and external sources, and may not be held liable for the content, advertising, products, services or any other material available on or from these web sites or external sources.</dd>
    <dt class=""heading-5"">Management of personal data</dt>
    <dd>You can view or edit your personal data online for many of our services. You can also make choices about our collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which services you use. You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from our store by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by visiting and signing into Company Promotional Communications Manager, which allows you to update contact information, manage contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with our partners. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain store services.</dd>
    <dt class=""heading-5"">Information We Collect</dt>
    <dd>Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a personal account. We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For example, we supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use services from other companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your location. The data we collect depends on the services and features you use.</dd>
    <dt class=""heading-5"">How We Use Your Information</dt>
    <dd>Our store uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate our business and provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, to send communications, including promotional communications, and to display advertising. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various store services you use to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.</dd>
    <dt class=""heading-5"">Sharing Your Information</dt>
    <dd>We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. In addition, we share personal data among our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.</dd>

	        <p>What can be more convenient than having all the assortment of any-type-of-products in one place? When you don’t have to dash to different shops looking for a specific brand, whether it is a bathroom cleaner or an activity tracker. All-in-one-shop, this is a way to save your time and money. Although you must already have an objection to it: what about those hour-length lines when you’ve bought household stuff for 2 months in advance, saved money, but still waste time standing in a queue?</p>
<p>Let’s see on which exactly products you can save your money: electronics, movies, books, furniture, auto & home improvement, pharmacy, crafts. Also, you save on food, pet products, toys, games and party supplies. Apart from that, you can pay less than usual for beauty items, sports clothing and equipment, office stuff and… the list is almost endless. In all this rich variety of choice of thousands items there is, however, an easy navigation so you get the best search experience.

        <div class=""text-block"">
            <p>Quite often, even after we’ve chosen an item and purchased it successfully, there may be some things we might want to change or repair afterward - either during or following the delivery process, when filing a return or applying for using our warranty. Here we'll try to explain in plain terms how does our store’s warranty policy works and how you can be using it when shopping with us!</p>
        </div>
        <div class=""text-block"">
            <h3>What Products are Provided with the Warranty?</h3>
            <p>Some of our furniture items apply for an almost unconditional Lifetime Warranty. The items included in this policy are sofas, couches, love seats, upholstered chairs, ottomans, sectionals, and sleepers. As a retailer we warrant these components to you, the original retail purchaser, to be free from material manufacturing defects. The lifetime duration of the Warranty means the standardized usage cycle for a specific furniture item.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Repair & Refurbishing</h4>
                    <span>Our store will pay, within one year from the date of purchase, reasonable and conditional labor rates for refurbishing or replacing the defective parts and shipping costs.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Different Types of Warranty</h4>
                    <span>While for some items we have a lifetime warranty, the springs in all of our items are offered with a 5 Year Limited type of a Warranty.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Warranty Exceptions</h4>
                    <span>All seat cushion cores have a natural tendencey to become softer during a normal usage cycle, and will conform to the shape of the user. A Limited 1 Year Warranty applies.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class=""text-block"">
            <h3>Where to Apply for Warranty Services?</h3>
            <p>Under these Limited Warranties, all of the legal liability of our store is limited to repair, or  if required (or requested by the customer), replacement. We are  ready to pay, within one year from the date of purchase, reasonable and customary labor rates to repair or replace the defective parts and shipping costs from the retailer...</p>
            <p>These Limited Warranties are not applicable for any of our products which ave been altered by any person, dealer, or company without the express written authorization of our store. PLease note, that some States Do Not Allow Limitations On How Long An Implied Warranty Lasts, So The Above Limitations May Not Apply To You.</p>
        </div>
        <div class=""text-block"">
            <h3>In What Cases the Warranty is Not Provided?</h3>
            <p>There can be two limits for the Warranties issued with the purchase of the furniture items on our website.</p>
            <ul class=""row"">
                <li class=""col-m-6"">
                    <h4>1, 3 & 5 Years Limited Warranty</h4>
                    <span>The first one is the Warranty time frame, if it is limited to 1, 3 or 5 years. Hence the Lifetime Warranty is not time-restricted.</span>
                </li>
                <li class=""col-m-6"">
                    <h4>Regular Usage Check</h4>
                    <span>The second one is the examination of the item by our customer support agent, making sure the usage was regular.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class=""text-block"">
            <h3>Change and Return</h3>
            <p>Filing a change or a return is an easy process, requiring nothing more than your proof of purchase (which usually is the receipt you received), the item itself and the return label printed out by you and put at the top of the package...</p>
